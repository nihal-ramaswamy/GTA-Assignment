# Boruvka's Algorithm
Finds the minimum spanning tree of the input graph <br>

## Output
The output file contains the following: <br>
The first line contains the text `Reverse Delete MST:` <br>
The next line contains the weight of the MST generated by the said algorithm. <br>
The next `N` lines (`N` representing the number of nodes in the graph) contains the following: <br>
`u: {v1, w1} {v2 w2}....` <br>
`u` represents the node under consideration. <br>
`v_i` represents the nodes from where there is an edge to from `u` with a weight `w_i`. <br>
