# Welsh Powell's Algorithm
Finds the chromatic colouring <br>

## Output
The output contains `N` lines in the following format: <br>
`i: c_i` where `i` represents the node and `c_i` represents the color given to the particular node. <br>
The last line contains the text `Chromatic Number: X` where `X` represents the chromatic number of the graph. <br>
