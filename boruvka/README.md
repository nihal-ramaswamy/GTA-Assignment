# Boruvka's Algorithm
Finds the minimum spanning tree of the input graph

## Output
The output file contains the following:
The first line contains the text `MST By boruvkaMST:`
The next `N` lines (`N` representing the number of nodes in the graph) contains the following:
`u: {v1, w1} {v2 w2}....`
`u` represents the node under consideration.
`v_i` represents the nodes from where there is an edge to from `u` with a weight `w_i`.
The last line contains the weight of the MST generated by the said algorithm.
